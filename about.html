    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Random Access Music is a clean and sleek music discovery and reviewing platform that allows users to discover new music and artists based off of other user ratings. Our goal is to have a user maintained website, where users can discover new songs based off of what other people are listening to. Our platform will include features such as verified critics, for users who are experienced with critiquing music. Additional features will include general user reviews, for any user who creates an account with the site and music will be rated on a five star system. Also, having a section for featured songs, albums, and artists of the week, and user-rated billboards. </p>
    <br>
  <p>Reviews can be submitted by any user if there are no existing reviews for the album/song. This can be done possibly by using the Spotify API to make it easy on users looking for particular songs, as well as making it easier on the back end of development. Reviews will be averaged and given an user average star rating. Verified reviews will be displayed separately to community reviews, with a similar system, but it will show a brief description of their rating below it.
