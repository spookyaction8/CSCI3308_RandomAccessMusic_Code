# CSCI3308_RandomAccessMusic_Code
Code for CSCI3308 group project

Description:

This is the code for Random Access Music which is a clean and sleek music platform. This allows users to discover other's opinions on 
different songs. Our goal is to have a user maintained website, where users can discover new songs based off of what other people are 
listening to. Our platform will include features like general user reviews, for any user who creates an account with the site and music 
will be rated on a five star system. Also, having a section for featured songs, albums, and artists of the week, and user-rated billboards.
Reviews can be submitted by any user if there are no existing reviews for the album/song. This can be done possibly by using the Spotify API
to make it easy on users looking for particular songs, as well as making it easier on the back end of development. Reviews will be averaged
and given an user average star rating. Verified reviews will be displayed separately to community reviews, with a similar system, but it 
will show a brief description of their rating below it.

Key Features:
● General user reviews
● Billboards/ Charts
● Rating scale (out of 5)
● Accounts (username, password)
● Website
● Featured albums, songs, artists
● Search function (optimizing search engine)
● Up and Coming Artists (Extra Feature if we have time)

We used html, css, bootstrap, php, postgres, heroku (for hosting), python (for automated testing) and c++.
